# Edited version of Keyston Enclave

This project is based on Keystone enclave, an open-source enclave framework for RISC-V processors.
The edited version comes from the need to have different requirements for my Thesis project.
All the differences from the original project will be described in the next section.

# Edited version of Keyston Enclave: Differences 

#1. The phase of Secure Boot (done in the bootrom) is now performing the hash of the SM and validating it with a golden value.
